>>> rfc-reader

This command downloads the plaintext version of RFCs from
rfc-editor.org so that they can be read at the command line.

The last 100 downloaded RFCs are saved locally so that they can be
read later on without the need for an internet connection.

Commands:
  rfc-reader help [COMMAND]  # Describe available commands or one specific command
  rfc-reader library         # List already downloaded RFCs for reading
  rfc-reader recent          # List recent RFC releases for reading
  rfc-reader search [TERM]   # Search for RFCs by TERM for reading
  rfc-reader version         # Print the program version
